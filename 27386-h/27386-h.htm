<div class="blockquote"><p>[A paper read by William P. Upham at a meeting of the
Peabody Historical Society at the Needham house, West
Peabody, September 2nd., 1903.]</p></div>

<p>It is now nearly forty years since I assisted my father, the
late Charles W. Upham, in the preparation of his work on Salem
Village and the Witchcraft tragedy of 1692, by collecting what
information could be obtained from the records as to the people
and their homes in that locality. In doing this I was enabled to
construct a map showing the bounds of the grants and farms at
that time. On that map is represented quite accurately the
Downing Farm, so called, owned, in 1638, by Emanuel Downing,
father of Sir George Downing, and occupied as tenant, in 1692, by
John Procter, the victim of the witchcraft delusion. When I made
the map I knew that John Procter at his death owned, as appears
by the inventory of his estate, fifteen acres of land in Salem,
but I was not able then to locate it with exactness. Lately, in
making a more complete study of the records relating to the
Downing farm and the surrounding lands I have learned the exact
situation of the fifteen acre lot owned by him, and also that he
had a house upon it as early as 1682 and until his death in 1692.
It appears that this lot is the place where he was buried,
according to the family tradition, although the knowledge as to
its being once owned by him seems to have passed out of the
neighborhood for more than a century.</p>

<p><!-- Page 4 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>This lot is indicated, on the accompanying map of the locality
which I have drawn for the purpose, by heavy dark lines. It was
on the north side of Lowell Street in West Peabody, just west of
the westernmost line of the Downing Farm and about one hundred
and fifty rods east from the place of this meeting, which is the
Needham homestead on the Newburyport Turnpike, or Newbury Street
as it is now called, marked on the map as then, in 1692, the home
of Anthony Needham, Junior.</p>

<p>The discovery that this was John Procter's land called to mind a
conversation I had with Mrs. Jacobs, an aged lady who lived in
the old Jacobs house, now the Wyman place, and of which I made
the following memorandum about thirty years ago:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jacobs (Munroe) says that it was always said that Procters
were buried near the bars as you go into the Philip H. Saunders
place. Mr. James Marsh says he always heard that John Procter, of
witch time, was buried there."</p>

<p>Upon inquiring lately of Mrs. Osborn, the librarian of the
Peabody Historical Society, as to what was the family tradition,
I learned that it was said by Mrs. Hannah B. Mansfield, of
Danvers, that John Procter was buried "opposite to the Colcord"
(now the Wyman) "pasture, amongst the rocks." In answer to
an inquiry by Mrs. Osborn, Mrs. Mansfield wrote to her as
follows:&mdash;"A great aunt took me, when a little girl, with her to
a spot in a rocky hill where she picked blackberries, and said
there was the place 'among birch trees and rocks where our
ancestor of witchcraft notoriety was buried.' It was on the north
side of Lowell Street in what was then called the Marsh pasture
nearly opposite the Jacobs farm which is on the south side of
Lowell Street."</p>

<p>The Marsh pasture from which Mrs. Mansfield's aunt pointed out
the "birch trees and rocks" near by where<!-- Page 5 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> John Procter was
buried was, no doubt, the pasture conveyed by James Marsh to
Philip H. Saunders, 11 June, 1863, and then described as
"thirteen acres known by the name of Bates Pasture." I do not
know of any other place near there that would be called the Marsh
pasture at the time Mrs. Mansfield mentions. This thirteen acre
pasture was conveyed by Ezekiel Marsh to John Marsh, 15 Oct.,
1819, having been devised to him by his father Ezekiel Marsh. It
had a way leading to it from Lowell Street over the eastern end
of the John Procter lot as shown on my map. This way is still
used as well as the bars opening into it on Lowell Street a few
rods east of the westerly way leading southerly to the Jacobs, or
Wyman, place. These are the "bars as you go into the Philip H.
Saunders place" mentioned by Mrs. Jacobs as stated above, unless
we suppose the expression to mean bars leading from the John
Procter lot where the way enters the Philip H. Saunders place, or
Marsh pasture, as Mrs. Mansfield calls it. Perhaps the latter
locality is the most probable since it is high rocky ground; but
which bars were meant is uncertain.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel H. Felton, who has an intimate knowledge of the
history of all the lands about Felton's Hill, and is himself a
descendant of John Procter, informs me that Mrs. Hannah B.
Mansfield some years since related to him "that she went berrying
at the Jacobs farm when she was a child and that older persons
said that John Procter was buried on the opposite side of the way
(among the rocks) from where they turned off from Lowell Street
to go to the Jacobs farm." Mrs. Mansfield lived when a child on
the Newburyport Turnpike opposite the Needham homestead. It was,
I understand, her "aunt Betsey Gardner" who, when picking
blackberries "on a rocky hill" pointed out to her the place
"among birch trees and rocks" where John Procter was buried.</p>

<p>To reconcile these traditions with the known facts, we<!-- Page 6 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> may
suppose, as related by Mrs. Jacobs and Mrs. Mansfield, that the
place of burial was pointed out to them from the high land on
the Jacobs place south of Lowell Street, where the "rocky hill"
and the bars leading into the Marsh pasture on the north side
of Lowell Street could be plainly seen. Subsequently Mrs.
Mansfield's aunt took her to the rocky hill itself and pointed
out the exact spot, probably close to where the bars lead into
the Marsh pasture, now the Saunders place. In going home from the
Jacobs farm they would turn into Lowell Street at the old way
near the house marked "White" on my map, and some ten rods
westerly from the way above mentioned leading from the opposite
side of Lowell Street to the Saunders place. This way from the
Jacobs place is a very old way. Mr. Felton tells me: "I recollect
that my father said over forty years ago that the gate posts of
locust were nearly one hundred years old then."</p>

<p>Two hundred years ago the Saunders place, formerly the Marsh
pasture, was part of the large tract of homestead land owned by
Anthony Needham. This Needham land included eight acres of land
conveyed by Anthony Needham to his son-in-law, Thomas Gould, 26
Sept., 1705, and conveyed to Thomas Gardner 27 Jan., 1743, by
George Gould, the son of Thomas Gould. The eight acre lot
descended to John Gardner and from him to John Gardner Walcott,
and is where John G. Walcott, Jun., now lives.</p>

<p>The land which I find to be identical with the fifteen acre lot
owned by John Procter is on the north side of Lowell Street
between the above mentioned eight acre lot, now the home of John
G. Walcott, Jun., and the lot marked "Flint Pasture" on my map,
the Procter lot being enclosed by heavy black lines. The westerly
part of the Flint Pasture was conveyed, 17 Sept., 1898, to John
D. Dennis, who lives there now.</p>

<p>The uniform family tradition that John Procter was<!-- Page 7 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> buried in the
locality I have thus described, is confirmed in my mind from a
consideration of certain facts, bearing with more or less
definiteness upon the question, which I will endeavor briefly to
recite.</p>

<p>It is well known that the victims executed as witches on Gallows
Hill in Salem, in 1692, were thrown into mere shallow graves or
crevices in the ledge under the gallows, where the nature of the
ground did not allow complete burial, so that it was stated at
the time that portions of the bodies were hardly covered at all.
It was natural that the relatives of those thus cruelly put to
death and left practically without burial, should, where they
were able and courageous enough for the dangerous undertaking,
remove the bodies to their homes for interment. It is the
tradition that this was done in several cases, secretly and
during the night, that it might not incur the opposition of the
frenzied and deluded people. This removal was made by the
children of Rebecca Nourse, and a beautiful monument now marks
the spot to which her body was removed. There is a similar
tradition in the Procter family, and there is good reason to
believe that his body was removed in a similar manner. But if so,
the necessary secrecy with which the sad duty was performed has
caused the place where he was buried to be known only by the
slender thread of tradition which I have mentioned.</p>

<p>The boulder inscribed to the memory of John Procter, which was
dedicated this past year at the junction of Lowell and Summit
Streets in Peabody, must be considered to have been placed there
not as indicating the locality of his burial, but because
that was the most suitable and available ground in the near
neighborhood of the house where for so many years and at the time
of his death he lived as the tenant of the great Downing Farm.
There was the entrance to the Farm from Salem, and from that spot
one obtains a full view of the farm house where he lived,<!-- Page 8 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
believed to be in part still standing on the same site, and of
the fine and far extending tillage land which probably first
attracted the admiration of Emanuel Downing two hundred and
seventy years ago, and is now found so attractive and admirably
suited to the purposes of a golf ground by the Salem Country
Club.</p>

<p>What is now known as the Procter Tomb on the north side of Lowell
Street at the southeastern corner of the Downing Farm is of
modern origin. We cannot believe that John Procter's family would
have deposited his body in ground to which they then had no title
except as tenants. At the time of the imprisonment of John
Procter and his wife Elizabeth the family was no doubt broken up
and the house stripped of everything that could be taken away to
pay the fees of arrest and imprisonment. The great farm was no
longer their home and they were not again in a position to return
to and occupy it as their own until nearly a decade had passed,
when, through the efforts of Thorndike, one of the sons of John
Procter, the Downing Farm in its entirety was purchased from
Charles, the grandson of Emanuel Downing and son of Sir George
Downing, then deceased.</p>

<p>At the time of his death in 1692 John Procter owned, except what
land in Ipswich he may have inherited from his father, only the
fifteen acres with a house upon it, which, as I have said, was
just west of the Downing Farm on the north side of Lowell Street.
This fact alone would render it entirely probable that when the
body was removed, in 1692, it would be carried to this place. In
fact, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the necessity of
secrecy and the otherwise homeless condition of the family, no
other place would have been chosen.</p>

<p>And now that direct tradition of the descendants, independently
of any knowledge that John Procter owned this land, confirms this
view by so remarkably agreeing with<!-- Page 9 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> long forgotten records as to
the locality, it may be said confidently that we know with
reasonable certainty the spot where these revered and honored
relics were laid so long ago. The "bars as you go into the Philip
H. Saunders place" are still there, and the way through is still
used and marks the place where in 1708 John Higginson 3d and
Hannah wife, in conveying to Daniel and Lawrence Southwick the
nine acre lot next east of Procter's lot, reserved the liberty of
a "highway of one pole wide at the western end of said land to be
for ye use of Anthony Needham Sen," "they to maintain a pair of
sufficient bars next ye common highway so long as they use the
same."</p>

<p>Anthony Needham, Sen., at that time owned what has recently been
known as the Philip H. Saunders place, and this right of way was
for the benefit of that place. Mr. Dennis now lives at the
westerly end of the nine acre lot conveyed by Higginson, as above
mentioned, which was long known as the "Flint Pasture." The bars
and the way are now on the west side of the wall dividing the
Dennis land from the Procter lot instead of being on the east
side; indicating that the dividing line was at some time changed.
This change may have been made without any evidence of it
appearing on record, by Zachariah King, who owned both lots from
1811 till 1818; and this would account for the apparent change in
size of the two lots as described in the deeds, the westerly (or
Procter) lot increasing while the easterly lot decreased.</p>

<p>On the north side of Lowell Street, about half way between these
bars and the John G. Walcott, Jun., house, is a well on the edge
of the road against a steep rocky hill rising back of it. This, I
understand, has sometimes been called the "Procter well." There
seems to be no room for a house close by it on that side of the
road, but it is possible that the road may anciently have turned
more to the south at this point, though I have not found any
evidence in the records to that effect.</p>

<p><!-- Page 10 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>The history of the John Procter house and fifteen acres of land,
as derived from the records, may be briefly stated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Before we can understand the meaning of the deeds of the Procter
lot we must know something of the history of the Downing Farm and
particularly of the nine acre lot known formerly as the Flint
Pasture, which is the large area of cleared land on the north
side of Lowell Street, on the west end of which is at present the
house of Mr. Dennis. That this may be better understood at a
glance I have marked on my sketch, by a broken line, the bounds
of the Downing Farm, which included the "Flint Pasture."</p>

<p>It seems that about two hundred and seventy years ago Roger
Morey, a companion and it is thought a relative or connection of
Roger Williams, had a grant of forty or fifty acres, which was
located to the west or southwest of a large tract granted to
Robert Cole and sold to Emanuel Downing before 1638. The Roger
Morey grant was on both sides of what is now Lowell Street, that
part on the northerly side being the same nine or ten acres above
mentioned as afterwards known by the name of the Flint Pasture.</p>

<p>In a deposition by Nathaniel Felton Sept. 18, 1700, he being then
85 years of age, he says: "Soon after Roger Morrey removed from
Salem, which was before 1644, I, this deponent, heard that said
Morrey had sold his land in the woods to Emanuel Downing and I do
further testify [as to?] a parcel of swamp or upland &amp; meadow
being a part and belonging to ye said Morrey, and [it] lyeth at
the westerly end of Mr. Downing's farm"&mdash;deponent "has lived
about 55 years a near neighbor to said farm and never heard that
said Morrey's land was claimed by anybody but the tenants living
on Mr. Downing's farm." [Reg'y of Deeds, Salem, B. 15, Fol. 5.]
Fortunately for the identification of this land, a most
remarkable bound often referred to in the ancient deeds is still
to be seen marking the exact northeasterly<!-- Page 11 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> corner of the Morey
grant. It is a high and precipitous rock about twenty rods
northerly from Lowell street just opposite the house on the south
side which was formerly the house of Nathaniel Flint, and a few
rods westerly from the easterly way leading southerly to the
Wyman Farm. It forms the northeasterly corner bound of the
"Flint Pasture," and is marked on my sketch "Morey's Bound,"
that being the name given to it in the numerous ancient deeds
and depositions.</p>

<p>The return of the settlement of the northwesterly bounds of the
Downing Farm in 1681, recorded in Salem town records, gives the
line from the extreme northwestern corner by Putnam's land as
running "strait on to a white oak called Morey's Bound."</p>

<p>In a controversy which seems to have existed in 1685 and in 1690
between Anthony Needham and the owners of land adjoining his,
presumably the owners of the Downing Farm, Nathaniel Felton
testifies that "about 30 years since" (that is about 1660) "Mr.
Thomas Gardner and Jeffry Massey (who by virtue of a grant of 200
acres due unto Mr. Bacon<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>) when they went to lay out the said
200 acres I this deponent went with them, where cominge upon the
land neere adjoyning to the farm called Mr. Downings farme, the
first bound they made of the said two hundred acres was upon a
hill being as I conceive about 20 rods on the north side of the
highway<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> leading up to Joseph Pope's farme, and was a white oak
sufficiently marked, ye which white oak the surveyors affirmed
was the northeast corner bounds of [Moreys]<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> farm, from thence
they went upon a<!-- Page 12 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> straight line westward to another white oak
which was marked also upon four sides, and stood neer about 20
rods to the northward of ye said highway which the said surveyors
affirmed to be the northwest corner bounds of the said [Morey's]
farme, and it also was the northeast corner bounds of John Marsh
his farme, which did joyne to ye [Morey] farme; and I doe further
testifie that John Marsh shewed me the said white oake and
affirmed it to be the northeast corner bound of his land and the
northwest corner bound of [Morey's] land."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> There are depositions recorded in Essex Reg'y, B.
11, Fol. 186-9, by which it appears that Rebecca, wife of William
Bacon, was a daughter of Thomas Potter, Esq., and that her
brother, Humphrey Potter, was the father of Ann Potter,
afterwards the wife of Anthony Needham.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Now Lowell Street.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> In the record it is Massey, evidently a mistake, as
shown by Marsh's deposition, next given.</p></div>

<p>In 1685 Zachariah Marsh testifies that "about 25 years since my
father John Marsh, desirous I should know the bounds of his farme
took me along with him, and he then shewed me all the four corner
bounds belonging to his farme, and this I doe testifie that he
shewed me a white oake sufficiently marked standing about 20 rods
northward of the highway leading up to Joseph Pope's by a little
swamp the which oake my father affirmed was the northeast corner
bounds of his farme, and that it was also the northwest corner
bounds of Roger More's farme; and further I doe testifie that
when we run the line Anthony Needham being present owned the said
white oake to be the corner bounds of my father's farme, and this
is the bounds in controversy and ye same that Nath. Felton
attested unto, and hath ever been reputed so to be, no man that
ever I know having questioned it, till of late Anthony Needham."
This deposition was again sworn to in 1690. See Reg'y of Deeds at
Salem, Book 8, F. 181.</p>

<p>This controversy was probably between Anthony Needham and John
Procter as tenant of the Downing Farm, as appears by an action at
the Salem Court, Nov., 1685, for damage done to John Procter in
claiming "land belonging to the plaintiff as being in possession
of, and hiring the said land of the Worshipful Symon Bradstreet
Esq.," said land being part of a farm "formerly belonging to Mr.<!-- Page 13 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Emanuel Downing"&mdash;Bradstreet married the daughter of Downing.</p>

<p>The bounds described in these depositions are those of the "Flint
pasture" and have remained substantially unchanged to the present
day, as is evident to the eye, for, in passing along Lowell Street
one can see plainly the old and venerable looking stone wall
beginning at "Morey's Bound" on the top of the high rock and
running along in a westerly direction at about twenty rods
distance northerly from the street. In the deed of the Downing
Farm to Thorndike Procter 13 Sept., 1700, the two bounds testified
to by Felton and by Marsh are mentioned as follows:&mdash;the line
of the Downing Farm running from the northwest corner bound
"southwestward unto a white oak tree standing on the Rocks, and
from thence northwestward unto a swamp white oak stump standing
about 20 poles on the northerly side of the way leading to Anthony
Needhams" etc. In the deed by Thorndike Procter to his brother
Benjamin, in 1701, of that portion of the Downing Farm now owned
by Daniel Brown, the Morey bound is described as "a dead white
oak Bound Tree standing on the Rocks."</p>

<p>The portion of the Downing Farm marked on my sketch as the Flint
Pasture, being about nine or ten acres, was conveyed with other
portions by Thorndike Procter to Samuel Marble, in 1701, the two
bounds above mentioned being described in the same words. Samuel
Marble the next year conveyed the same to Samuel Gardner. Hannah,
the wife of John Higginson 3d, mentioned above as conveying this
lot to the Southwicks in 1708, was a daughter of Samuel Gardner.
Daniel Southwick, Jr., conveyed the same to Jonathan Flint in
1729 and he conveyed it to John Jacobs in 1738. John Jacobs left
it by will to his son Daniel, who conveyed it to Zachariah King
in 1775. By him it was divided between his daughters Desire
Procter<!-- Page 14 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> and Mary Upton, in 1818, and its history is thus brought
within the knowledge of those now living.</p>

<p>West of this Flint Pasture was the Procter fifteen acre lot, the
description of which in the deeds and depositions we can now
understand. How John Procter became owner of this fifteen acre
lot does not appear upon record, but as John Marsh appears, by
the depositions of Nathaniel Felton and Zachariah Marsh given
above, to have been the owner there originally, we may conjecture
that the title came from him by some unrecorded deed or
otherwise.</p>

<p>The following deed, dated 5 Nov., 1681, and recorded Book 6, Fol.
48, may throw some light on this question, as it apparently
conveys the eight acre lot which, as above mentioned, was
conveyed by Anthony Needham to his son-in-law Thomas Gould, in
1705, where John G. Walcott, Jun., now lives.</p>

<p>Joseph Procter of Ipswich conveys to Anthony Needham of Salem "a
certain tract of land being the third part of twenty three acres
of land (formerly the land of John Herod) lying and being in ye
towne of Salem aforesaid, the said twenty three acres of land
being bounded on ye northerly side with ye land of ye said
Needham, on ye south with ye highway, on ye west with ye land of
ye said Anthony Needham, and on ye east with ye land now in ye
occupation of John Procter."</p>

<p>Supposing this third part of the twenty-three acres to have
been the eight acre lot referred to above, being the only
locality that would agree with the description, the land in the
"occupation of John Procter" on the east side of the whole
"twenty three acres" would be the "Flint Pasture," part of the
Downing Farm, which was then, in 1681, in the occupation of John
Procter, as tenant. It is therefore quite probable that the
"fifteen acre" lot which John Procter owned was the other two
thirds part of the "twenty three acres," and that he became
possessed of it<!-- Page 15 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> in the same way that his brother, Joseph
Procter, became possessed of the third part, perhaps in the
division of an estate. What the estate was may be ascertained by
future investigation.</p>

<p>The first we know positively of the lot in question as being John
Procter's is through the record of an action which he brought at
the County Court, in 1685, against Steven Fish for nine pounds
ten shillings due for rent. Procter was nonsuited. Fish at the
same time sued Procter for non delivery of land hired of him by
lease March 1st, 1681, (1681-2). The jury found for a delivery of
the land according to the lease.</p>

<p>In 1689 John Procter "for my love and parental affection unto my
beloved wife Elizabeth Procter and all her children" conveys to
certain trustees for their benefit "all my estate for their
supply and maintenance and make over and give to them my house
and land lying in Salem bounds containing fifteen acres, more or
less, bounded with ye land of Anthony Needham northwest and east
southerly<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> and south and west with ye common road or highway in
part and partly alsoe with land of John Marsh and some land of
Thomas Gardner Sen. that comes within the highway." The last
words in this description are puzzling and perhaps indicate that
the road at the westerly end of the lot ran further to the south
than it does to-day.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> This probably refers to the way which Needham had to
his land over the western end of the lot lying next east of the
Procter lot.</p></div>

<p>The next information is obtained from a deposition by Anthony
Needham, Thomas Gould and Isaac Needham, in 1730, taken "<i>in
perpetuam rei memoriam</i>" and recorded in the Registry, Book 54,
Leaf 246, as follows:&mdash;They testify that "they very well knew
that Mr. John Procter late of Salem, deceased, possessed in his
own right for several years before and untill ninety two<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> a
certain tract of land<!-- Page 16 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> situate in Salem aforesaid containing
about 15 acres, butting easterly on land now in ye possession of
Jonathan Flint, southerly and southwesterly on the highway
leading to Joseph Popes,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> northwesterly and northerly on land
of the deponent Thomas Gould and northeasterly on land of Thomas
Needham. That the said John Procter had a house upon the
abovesaid land which he leased to one Stephen Fish<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> since let
to one Lincoln and to one Bates, who improved it under and in
right of the said John Procter. That Benjamin Procter son of the
said John Procter possessed and improved ye above described
parcel of land from the year 1692 untill his decease which
happened about fourteen years since. That Mary the widow of said
Benjamin Procter and her son John Procter have possessed and
improved the same right from the time of his decease untill this
day." The deposition is dated Jan. 7, 1730. The name of "Bates
pasture" applied to the Philip H. Saunders place in the deed from
Marsh, in 1863, suggests the thought that it may have been
derived from the Bates mentioned in the deposition as one of the
tenants of the John Procter house.</p>

<p>It only remains to trace the title of the John Procter lot to the
present time. It appears from various deeds and other records
that the title descended from John Procter to his son Benjamin,
and then to his son John, the grandson of the first named John
Procter. From him it passed to his son Benjamin, and then to this
Benjamin's sons, James and Francis Procter. Francis gave a deed
of it to James April 19, 1802. Desire Procter, widow and
administratrix of James Procter, conveyed it to Zachariah King
Aug. 9, 1811, describing it as "a certain piece of land called
the upper pasture situate in said Danvers containing sixteen
acres, be the same more or less, and is bounded as follows,<!-- Page 17 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
viz.&mdash;southerly on the highway, northwesterly and northerly on
land of John Gardner, Jr., northeasterly on land of Ezekiel
Marsh, and southeasterly on land of the said Zachariah King to
the bound first mentioned." Zachariah King conveyed the same to
his daughter, Desire Procter of Danvers, widow, Feb. 18, 1818.</p>

<p>From Desire Procter the title descended to Rebecca P. Osborne,
her granddaughter, and others who, in 1889, conveyed the lot to
Harriet A. Walcott, wife of John G. Walcott, the description
being as follows:&mdash;"a parcel of land in that part of Peabody
called West Peabody, containing about seventeen acres and
two fourths and formerly called the Upper Pasture, bounded
southwesterly by Lowell Street about ninety two rods and eleven
links, northwesterly by land of Walcott, formerly of John
Gardner, about thirty eight rods, northeasterly by land of
Walcott, formerly of Gardner, and by land of Philip Marsh,
formerly of Ezekiel Marsh, about seventy six rods and nineteen
links, southeasterly by other land of the grantors, formerly of
Zachariah King, about seventeen rods and fourteen links."</p>

<p>John G. Walcott and Harriet A. Walcott, wife, conveyed the same
to Mary E. Collins, wife of William F. M. Collins, by deed dated
June 27, 1898.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
